As of submission time, I am happy to report that my project is working! See included video, including switch operation.

My one problem with the submission comes down to one line - line 19 in pg.v. This line puts the vertical restriction on
the box, and while it is nice to have, the testbench was created before I had placed that restriction. For the Modelsim
screenshot, then, this line was commented out in order to show that the switches do indeed have an effect on the color
output of the VGA.

With that minor exception, all is functioning as intended. I have not added motion yet but would be happy to if needed!
